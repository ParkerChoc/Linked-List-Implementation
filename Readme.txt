USER INPUT
    The beginning prompt asks for whether the user wishes to use integers or
    unsigned integers. Enter a boolian value: either a 0 or a 1, and then
    press enter.

    The program then asks for what to do with the linked list after 
    displaying a menu with options. Each option corresponds to a charactor 
    that can be pressed and then entered. Only lowercase values allowed.

    In the event of adding a value to the linked list, the user will be
    prompted to enter a value that they wish to add. This value must be of
    the type (int or unsigned int) that they selected earlier. 

    If the user selected to insert, they must also enter in a non - negative
    integer. Zero is acceptable as it will enter in at the beginning of the
    list, functioning like push_front. 

    Important note: the way to exit this program is to press q with the menu
    up and then hit enter. This is the only way to safely leave the program.

EXTRA CREDIT
    1) sort_descending() is implemented using a recursive selection sort
    algorithm. It can be found in sorting_&_algorithms.hpp.

    2) this assignment is implemented with a template class. The user is 
    initially prompted which data type they wish to make the linked list 
    with.

FILE SEPARATION
    This assignment has the sorting algorithms and the prime number function 
    in its own file called sorting_&_algorithms.hpp. 
    
OUTSIDE INFLUENCE
    Some algorithms were insipred by outside sources, however all of the work
    is mine and I have done my best to comment my thought process through the 
    sorting algorithms and prime number function. 
    
    As can be expeced I suppose, my work is simmilar to online sources, 
    however this seems like a sort of natural conclusion as I have built the
    algorithms to be as efficinet as I can.
